My Webcam ESP32 Cam


This is saved here because it is the one that actually works.

Set first with esphome in homeassistant then down load the modern file and install via https://web.esphome.io/
From there home assistant should find it and add the code from # Example configuration entry onwards. 

It only worked after trying another cam which kept losing connection after adding the code for the actual camsera. Might have been faulty so beware.
